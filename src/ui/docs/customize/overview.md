#### Customize

Learn how to theme, customize, and extend Universal with Sass, a boatload of global options, an expansive color system, and more.

There are multiple ways to customize Universal. Your best path can depend on your project, the complexity of your build tools, the version of Universal you're using, browser support, and more.

Our two preferred methods are:

1. Using Universal [via package manager](#/docs/getting-started/download.md) so you can use and extend our source files.
2. Using Universal's compiled distribution files or [jsDelivr](#/docs/getting-started/download.md) so you can add onto or override Universal's styles.

While we cannot go into details here on how to use every package manager, we can give some guidance on [using Universal with your own Sass compiler](#/docs/customize/sass.md").

For those who want to use the distribution files, review the [getting started page](#/docs/index.md) for how to include those files and an example HTML page. From there, consult the docs for the layout, components, and behaviors you'd like to use.

As you familiarize yourself with Universal, continue exploring this section for more details on how to utilize our global options, making use of and changing our color system, how we build our components, how to use our growing list of CSS custom properties, and how to optimize your code when building with Universal.
